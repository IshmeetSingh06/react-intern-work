        <li>
          TakTik app allows the users to form their own opinion related to a
          particular event. TakTik apps provide questions relating to the
          probability of the occurrence of a specified future event, data and

          specified events, the users are encouraged to collect their own data
          and conduct thorough analysis related to the specific event before
          taking any positions/bids. User’s should take positions once they have
          estimated the probability of occurrence of an event.
